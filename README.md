## 🎯 Why I Built This

While preparing conference talks, I needed to know **how long I spent on each slide**, not just the total duration.  
Traditional timers only show cumulative time, so I built this tool to track **per‑segment timing in real time**.

Useful for:
- rehearsing presentations  
- timing workflows  
- tracking time spent on tasks  
- any scenario where “lap time” matters
